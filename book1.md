# FOREWORD BY RICK

# WARREN

You’ve undoubtedly heard the expression “Time
heals all wounds.” Unfortunately, it isn’t true. As a
pastor I frequently talk with people who are still
carrying hurts from thirty or forty years ago. The
truth is, time often makes things worse. Wounds that
are left untended fester and spread infection
throughout your entire body. Time only extends the
pain if the problem isn’t dealt with.

Celebrate Recovery® is a biblical and balanced
program that can help you overcome your hurts,
habits, and hang-ups. Based on the actual words of
Jesus rather than psychological theory, this recovery
program is more effective in helping people change
than anything else I’ve seen or heard of. Over the
years I’ve witnessed how the Holy Spirit has used
this program to transform literally thousands of lives
at Saddleback Church and help people grow toward
full Christlike maturity.
Perhaps you are familiar with the classic 12-Step


program of AA and other groups. While undoubtedly
many lives have been helped through the 12 Steps,
I’ve always been uncomfortable with that program’s
vagueness about the nature of God, the saving power
of Jesus Christ, and the ministry of the Holy Spirit.
So I began an intense study of the Scriptures to
discover what God had to say about “recovery.” To
my amazement, I found the principles of recovery —
in their logical order — given by Christ in His most
famous message, the Sermon on the Mount.
My study resulted in a ten-week series of
messages called “The Road to Recovery.” During
that series my associate pastor John Baker developed
the four participant’s guides, which became the heart
of our Celebrate Recovery program.
As you work through these participant’s guides, I
trust that you will come to realize many benefits from
this program. Most of all, however, my prayer for
you is that, through Celebrate Recovery, you will find
deep peace and lasting freedom in Jesus Christ as
you walk your own road to recovery.

```
Dr. Rick Warren
Senior Pastor, Saddleback Church

# INTRODUCTION

Welcome to the “Road to Recovery.” You are in
for an exciting and amazing journey as you take the
hand of the true and only Higher Power, Jesus Christ,
and walk with Him toward healing and serenity.
The purpose of this program is to allow us to
become free from life’s hurts, hang-ups, and habits.
By working through the eight recovery principles
found in the Beatitudes with Jesus Christ as your
Higher Power, you can and will change! You will
begin to experience the true peace and serenity you
have been seeking, and you will no longer have to
rely on your dysfunctional, compulsive, and addictive
behaviors as a temporary “fix” for your pain.
By applying the biblical principles of conviction,
conversion, surrender, confession, restitution, prayer,
quiet time, witnessing, and helping one another,
which are found within the eight principles and the
Christ-centered 12 Steps, you will restore and
develop stronger relationships with others and with
God.
To begin our journey, we will need to step out of


denial and into God’s grace. This is what working
through Principles 1 – 3 will help us accomplish. We
begin by looking at the toll _denial_ has had on our
ability to face the reality of our past and present.
Then we need to admit that we are _powerless_ over
certain areas of our lives, and that, alone, we do not
have the power to control them.
In Principle 2, we find the _hope_ that our Higher
Power, Jesus Christ, can restore us to _sanity_ and that
through Him alone we can find the power to help us
recover. And finally, in Principle 3, we take the _action_
to _turn_ our lives and our wills over to His care and
direction.
After each lesson, there is an exercise for you to
complete. Answer each question to the best of your
ability. Don’t worry about what you think the answer
_should_ be. Pray and then write down the answer
from your heart. Remember John 8:32: “Then you
will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”
After you have completed the exercise, share it
with someone you trust. Your group, an
accountability partner, your sponsor (someone
farther along in recovery who has agreed to be your
“travel guide”; sponsors are explained in Participant’s
Guide 2, Lesson 7), or a close friend in recovery are
all choices. You do not recover from your hurts,


hang-ups, and habits just by attending recovery
meetings. You must work and live following the eight
principles of recovery found in the Beatitudes and the
12 Steps and their biblical comparisons. God bless
you as you walk this road.

In His steps,
John Baker

# THE ROAD TO RECOVERY

# Eight Principles Based on

# the Beatitudes

## By Pastor Rick Warren

1. **R** ealize I’m not God. I admit that I am powerless
    to control my tendency to do the wrong thing and
    that my life is unmanageable.

```
“Happy are those who know they are
spiritually poor.” (Matthew 5:3)
```
2. **E** arnestly believe that God exists, that I matter to
    Him, and that He has the power to help me
    recover.

```
“Happy are those who mourn, for they
shall be comforted.” (Matthew 5:4)
```

3. **C** onsciously choose to commit all my life and
    will to Christ’s care and control.

```
“Happy are the meek.” (Matthew 5:5)
```
4. **O** penly examine and confess my faults to myself,
    to God, and to someone I trust.

```
“Happy are the pure in heart.” (Matthew
5:8)
```
5. **V** oluntarily submit to every change God wants to
    make in my life and humbly ask Him to remove
    my character defects.

```
“Happy are those whose greatest desire is
to do what God requires.” (Matthew 5:6)
```
6. **E** valuate all my relationships. Offer forgiveness to
    those who have hurt me and make amends for
    harm I’ve done to others, except when to do so
    would harm them or others.

```
“Happy are the merciful.” (Matthew 5:7)
“Happy are the peacemakers.” (Matthew
5:9)
```
7. **R** eserve a daily time with God for self-
    examination, Bible reading, and prayer in order to


```
know God and His will for my life and to gain the
power to follow His will.
```
8. **Y** ield myself to God to be used to bring this
    Good News to others, both by my example and
    by my words.

```
“Happy are those who are persecuted
because they do what God requires.”
(Matthew 5:10)
```

# TWELVE STEPS

# AND THEIR

# BIBLICAL

# COMPARISONS

## *

1. We admitted we were powerless over our
    addictions and compulsive behaviors, that our
    lives had become unmanageable.

```
“For I know that good itself does not
dwell in me, that is, in my sinful nature.
For I have the desire to do what is good,
but I cannot carry it out.” (Romans 7:18)
```
2. We came to believe that a power greater than
    ourselves could restore us to sanity.

```
“For it is God who works in you to will
and to act in order to fulfill his good
purpose.” (Philippians 2:13)
```

3. We made a decision to turn our lives and our
    wills over to the care of God.

```
“Therefore, I urge you, brothers and
sisters, in view of God’s mercy, to offer
your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and
pleasing to God — this is your true and
proper worship.” (Romans 12:1)
```
4. We made a searching and fearless moral
    inventory of ourselves.

```
“Let us examine our ways and test them,
and let us return to the LORD.”
(Lamentations 3:40)
```
5. We admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another
    human being the exact nature of our wrongs.

```
“Therefore confess your sins to each other
and pray for each other so that you may
be healed.” (James 5:16)
```
6. We were entirely ready to have God remove all
    these defects of character.

```
“Humble yourselves before the Lord, and
he will lift you up.” (James 4:10)
```

7. We humbly asked Him to remove all our
    shortcomings.

```
“If we confess our sins, he is faithful and
just and will forgive us our sins and purify
us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9)
```
8. We made a list of all persons we had harmed and
    became willing to make amends to them all.

```
“Do to others as you would have them do
to you.” (Luke 6:31)
```
9. We made direct amends to such people whenever
    possible, except when to do so would injure them
    or others.

```
“Therefore, if you are offering your gift at
the altar and there remember that your
brother or sister has something against
you, leave your gift there in front of the
altar. First go and be reconciled to them;
then come and offer your gift.” (Matthew
5:23 – 24)
```
10. We continued to take personal inventory and
    when we were wrong, promptly admitted it.

```
“So, if you think you are standing firm, be
```

```
careful that you don’t fall!” (1 Corinthians
10:12)
```
11. We sought through prayer and meditation to
    improve our conscious contact with God, praying
    only for knowledge of His will for us and power
    to carry that out.

```
“Let the message of Christ dwell among
you richly.” (Colossians 3:16)
```
12. Having had a spiritual experience as the result of
    these steps, we try to carry this message to
    others and to practice these principles in all our
    affairs.

```
“Brothers and sisters, if someone is caught
in a sin, you who live by the Spirit should
restore that person gently. But watch
yourselves, or you also may be tempted.”
(Galatians 6:1)
```
* Throughout this material, you will notice several
references to the Christ-centered 12 Steps. Our
prayer is that Celebrate Recovery will create a
bridge to the millions of people who are familiar
with the secular 12 Steps (I acknowledge the use


of some material from the 12 Suggested Steps of
Alcoholics Anonymous) and in so doing, introduce
them to the one and only true Higher Power, Jesus
Christ. Once they begin that relationship, asking
Christ into their hearts as Lord and Savior, true
healing and recovery can begin!


# SERENITY PRAYER

If you have attended secular recovery programs,
you have seen the first four lines of the “Prayer for
Serenity.” The following is the complete prayer. I
encourage you to pray it daily as you work through
the principles!

## Prayer for Serenity

```
God , grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change ,
the courage to change the things I can ,
and the wisdom to know the difference.
Living one day at a time ,
enjoying one moment at a time ;
accepting hardship as a pathway to peace ;
taking , as Jesus did ,
this sinful world as it is ,
not as I would have it ;
trusting that You will make all things right
```

_if I surrender to Your will_ ;
_so that I may be reasonably happy in this life
and supremely happy with You forever in the next.
Amen._
Reinhold Niebuhr


# CELEBRATE

# RECOVERY’S

# SMALL GROUP

# GUIDELINES

The following five guidelines will ensure that your
small group is a safe place. They need to be read at
the beginning of every meeting.

1. Keep your sharing focused on your own
    thoughts and feelings. Limit your sharing to
    three to five minutes.
2. There is NO cross talk. Cross talk is when two
    individuals engage in conversation excluding all
    others. Each person is free to express his or
    her feelings without interruptions.
3. We are here to support one another, not “fix”
    another.


4. Anonymity and confidentiality are basic
    requirements. What is shared in the group stays
    in the group. The only exception is when
    someone threatens to injure themselves or
    others.
5. Offensive language has no place in a Christ-
    centered recovery group.


## Lesson 1

# DENIAL

**Principle 1** : Realize I’m not God. I admit that
I am powerless to control my tendency to do
the wrong thing and that my life is
unmanageable.

```
“Happy are those who know they are
spiritually poor.” (Matthew 5:3)
```
**Step 1** : We admitted we were powerless over
our addictions and compulsive behaviors, that
our lives had become unmanageable.

```
“For I know that good itself does not
dwell in me, that is, in my sinful nature.
For I have the desire to do what is good,
but I cannot carry it out.” (Romans 7:18)
```

## Think About It

Before we can take the first step of our recovery,
we must first face and admit our denial.
God tells us, “You can’t heal a wound by saying
it’s not there!” (Jeremiah 6:14, TLB). The acrostic
for DENIAL spells out what can happen if we do not
face our denial.

## D isables our feelings

By repressing our feelings we freeze our
emotions. Understanding and feeling our feelings is
freedom.

```
“They promise them freedom, while they
themselves are slaves of destructive habits
— for we are slaves of anything that has
conquered us.” (2 Peter 2:19, GNT)
```
## E nergy lost

A side effect of our denial is anxiety. Anxiety
causes us to waste precious energy running from our


past and worrying about and dreading the future. It is
only in the present, today, where positive change can
occur.

```
“He frees the prisoners.. .; he lifts the
burdens from those bent down beneath
their loads.” (Psalm 146:7 – 8, TLB)
```
## N egates growth

We are “as sick as our secrets.” We cannot grow
in recovery until we are ready to step out of our
denial into the truth.

```
“They cried to the Lord in their troubles,
and he rescued them! He led them from
their darkness and shadow of death and
snapped their chains.” (Psalm 107:13 –
14, TLB)
```
## I solates us from God

God’s light shines on the truth. Our denial keeps
us in the dark.

```
“God is light; in him there is no darkness
at all. If we claim to have fellowship with
```

```
him yet walk in the darkness, we lie and
do not live out the truth. But if we walk in
the light, as he is in the light, we have
fellowship with one another, and the blood
of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin.”
(1 John 1:5 – 7)
```
## A lienates us from our relationships

Denial tells us we are getting away with it. We
think no one knows — but they do.
What is the answer?

```
“Stop lying to each other; tell the truth,
for we are parts of each other and when
we lie to each other we are hurting
ourselves.” (Ephesians 4:25, TLB)
```
## L engthens the pain

We have the false belief that denial protects us
from our pain. In reality, denial allows our pain to
fester and grow and turn into _shame_ and _guilt_.

```
God’s promise: “I will give you back your
health again and heal your wounds.”
(Jeremiah 30:17, TLB)
```

Accept the first principle of recovery. Step out of
your denial! Step into your Higher Power’s — Jesus
Christ’s — unconditional love and grace!

## Lesson 2

# POWERLESS

**Principle 1** : Realize I’m not God. I admit that
I am powerless to control my tendency to do
the wrong thing and that my life is
unmanageable.”

```
“Happy are those who know they are
spiritually poor.” (Matthew 5:3)
```
**Step 1** : We admitted we were powerless over
our addictions and compulsive behaviors, that
our lives had become unmanageable.

```
“For I know that good itself does not
dwell in me, that is, in my sinful nature.
For I have the desire to do what is good,
but I cannot carry it out.” (Romans 7:18)
```

## Think About It

When we accept the first recovery principle and
take that first step out of our denial and into reality,
we see there are very few things that we really have
control over. Once we admit that by ourselves we are
powerless we can stop living with the following
“serenity robbers,” spelled out in the acrostic
POWERLESS.

## P ride

```
Ignorance + power + pride = a deadly mixture!
```
```
“Pride ends in a fall, while humility
brings honor.” (Proverbs 29:23, TLB)
```
## O nly ifs

Our “only ifs” in life keep us trapped in the
fantasyland of rationalization!

```
“Whatever is covered up will be
uncovered, and every secret will be made
```

```
known. So then, whatever you have said in
the dark will be heard in broad daylight.”
(Luke 12:2 – 3, GNT)
```
## W orry

```
Worrying is a form of not trusting God enough!
```
```
“So don’t be anxious about tomorrow. God
will take care of your tomorrow too. Live
one day at a time.” (Matthew 6:34, TLB)
```
## E scape

By living in denial we may have escaped into a
world of fantasy and unrealistic expectations of
ourselves and others.

```
“For light is capable of showing up
everything for what it really is. It is even
possible for light to turn the thing it shines
upon into light also.” (Ephesians 5:13 –
14, PH)
```
## R esentments


Resentments act like an emotional cancer if they
are allowed to fester and grow.

```
“‘In your anger do not sin’: Do not let the
sun go down while you are still angry, and
do not give the devil a foothold.”
(Ephesians 4:26 – 27)
```
## L oneliness

Loneliness is a choice. In recovery and in Christ,
you never have to walk alone.

```
“Continue to love each other with true
brotherly love. Don’t forget to be kind to
strangers, for some who have done this
have entertained angels without realizing
it!” (Hebrews 13:1 – 2, TLB)
```
## E mptiness

You know that empty feeling deep inside. The
cold wind of hopelessness blows right through it.

```
Jesus said, “My purpose is to give life in
all its fullness.” (John 10:10, TLB)
```

## S elfishness

We often pray: “Our Father which art in heaven;
give me, give me, give me.”

```
“Whoever clings to his life shall lose it,
and whoever loses his life shall save it.”
(Luke 17:33, TLB)
```
## S eparation

Some people talk about finding God — as if He
could ever get lost!

```
“For I am convinced that nothing can
ever separate us from his love. Death
can’t, and life can’t. The angels won’t, and
all the powers of hell itself cannot keep
God’s love away.... Nothing will ever be
able to separate us from the love God
demonstrated by our Lord Jesus Christ
when he died for us.” (Romans 8:38 – 39,
TLB)
```
Congratulations! In your admission of your
powerlessness you have begun the journey of
recovery that will allow you to accept the true and


only Higher Power’s — Jesus Christ’s — healing,
love, and forgiveness.
At this stage in your recovery, you need to _stop_
doing two things:

## 1. Stop Denying the Pain

You are ready to take your first step in recovery
when your pain is greater than your fear.

```
“Pity me, O Lord, for I am weak. Heal
me, for my body is sick, and I am upset
and disturbed. My mind is filled with
apprehension and with gloom.” (Psalm
6:2 – 3, TLB)
```
## 2. Stop Playing God

You are unable to do for yourself what you need
God to do for you. You are either going to serve God
or yourself. You can’t serve both.

```
“You cannot be a slave of two masters;
you will hate one and love the other; you
will be loyal to one and despise the other.”
(Matthew 6:24, GNT)
```

In addition to stopping certain behaviors, you
need to start doing two things:

## 1. Start Admitting Your Powerlessness

As you work the first principle, you will see that
by yourself you do not have the power to change
your hurts, hang-ups, and habits.

```
“Jesus... said, ‘With man this is
impossible, but with God all things are
possible.’ ” (Matthew 19:26)
```
## 2. Start Admitting That Your Life Has

## Become Unmanageable

You can finally start admitting that some or all
areas of your life are out of your control to change.

```
“Problems far too big for me to solve are
piled higher than my head. Meanwhile my
sins, too many to count, have all caught
up with me and I am ashamed to look
up.” (Psalm 40:12, TLB).
```
## Principle 1 Prayer


```
Dear God, Your Word tells me that I can’t
heal my hurts, hangups, and habits by just
saying that they are not there. Help me! Parts
of my life, or all of my life, are out of
control. I now know that I cannot “fix”
myself. It seems the harder that I try to do the
right thing the more I struggle. Lord, I want
to step out of my denial into the truth. I pray
for You to show me the way. In Your Son’s
name I pray, Amen.
```
Note: Before you begin “Write About It,” read the
“Prayer for Serenity” on page 14 and read the
Principle 1 verses on page 31.

    onlys”?
    “If only” I had stopped

## Lesson 3

# HOPE

**Principle 2** : Earnestly believe that God exists,
that I matter to Him, and that He has the
power to help me recover.

```
“Happy are those who mourn, for they
shall be comforted.” (Matthew 5:4)
```
**Step 2** : We came to believe that a power
greater than ourselves could restore us to
sanity_._

```
“For it is God who works in you to will
and to act in order to fulfill his good
purpose.” (Philippians 2:13)
```

## Think About It

```
“Anyone who comes to [God] must
believe that he exists and that he rewards
those who earnestly seek him.” (Hebrews
11:6)
```
In the first principle, we admitted we were
powerless. Now in the second principle, we come to
believe God exists, that we are important to Him, and
that we are able to receive God’s power to help us
recover. It’s in the second step we find HOPE!

## H igher Power

Our Higher Power has a name: Jesus Christ!
Jesus desires a hands-on, day-to-day, moment-to-
moment relationship with us. He can do for us what
we have never been able to do for ourselves.

```
“Everything comes from God alone.
Everything lives by his power.” (Romans
11:36, TLB)
```
```
Our Higher Power tells us, “My grace is
enough for you: for where there is
weakness, my power is shown the more
```

```
completely.” (2 Corinthians 12:9, PH)
```
## O penness to change

Throughout our lives, we will continue to
encounter hurts and trials that we are powerless to
change. With God’s help, we need to be open to
allow those trials to change us. To make us better,
not bitter.
_“Now your attitudes and thoughts must all
be constantly changing for the better. Yes, you
must be a new and different person.”
(Ephesians 4:23, TLB)_

## P ower to change

In the past, we have wanted to change and were
unable to do so. We could not free ourselves from
our hurts, hang-ups, or habits. In Principle 2, we
come to understand that God’s power can change us
and our situation.

```
“For I can do everything God asks me to
with the help of Christ who gives me the
strength and the power.” (Philippians
4:13, TLB)
```

```
“Lead me; teach me; for you are the God
who gives me salvation. I have no hope
except in you.” (Psalm 25:5, TLB)
```
## E xpect to change

Remember you are only at the second principle.
Don’t quit before the miracle happens! With God’s
help, the changes that you have longed for are just
_steps_ away.

```
“I am sure that God who began the good
work within you will keep right on helping
you grow in his grace until his task within
you is finally finished on that day when
Jesus Christ returns.” (Philippians 1:6,
TLB)
```
How do we find hope? By faith in our Higher
Power, Jesus Christ.

```
“Now faith is confidence in what we hope
for and assurance about what we do not
see.” (Hebrews 11:1)
```

## Lesson 4

# SANITY

**Principle 2** : Earnestly believe that God exists,
that I matter to Him, and that He has the
power to help me recover.

```
“Happy are those who mourn, for they
shall be comforted.” (Matthew 5:4)
```
**Step 2** : We came to believe that a power
greater than ourselves could restore us to
sanity.

```
“For it is God who works in you to will
and to act in order to fulfill his good
purpose.” (Philippians 2:13)
```

## Think About It

_Insanity_ has been described as “doing the same
thing over and over again, expecting a different result
each time.”
_Sanity_ has been defined as “wholeness of mind;
making decisions based on the truth.”
The following are some of the gifts we will
receive when we believe that our Higher Power,
Jesus Christ, has the power and will restore us to
SANITY!

## S trength

Jesus gives us strength to face the fears that in
the past have caused us to fight, flee, or freeze.

```
“God is our refuge and our strength, an
ever-present help in trouble. Therefore we
will not fear.” (Psalm 46:1)
```
```
“My mind and my body may grow weak,
but God is my strength; he is all I ever
need.” (Psalm 73:26, GNT)
```
## A cceptance


We learn to have realistic expectations of
ourselves and others.

```
“Accept one another, then, for the glory of
God, as Christ has accepted you.”
(Romans 15:7, GNT)
```
## N ew life

We discover that we have an opportunity for a
second chance! We do not have to live by our old
ways any longer.

```
“When someone becomes a Christian he
becomes a brand new person inside. He is
not the same anymore. A new life has
begun!” (2 Corinthians 5:17, TLB)
```
## I ntegrity

We begin to follow through on our promises.
Others start trusting what we say.

```
“Nothing brings me greater joy than
hearing that my children are living in the
truth.” (3 John 4, PH)
```

## T rust

We begin to trust relationships with others and
our Higher Power, Jesus Christ!

```
“It is dangerous to be concerned with what
others think of you, but if you trust the
Lord, you are safe.” (Proverbs 29:25,
GNT)
```
## Y our Higher Power, Jesus Christ, loves

## you just the way you are!

No matter what you have done in the past, God
wants to forgive it!

```
“While we were still sinners, Christ died
for us.” (Romans 5:8)
```
No matter what shape your life is in today,
together God and you can handle it!

```
“And God is faithful; he will not let you
be tempted beyond what you can bear. But
when you are tempted, he will also provide
a way out.” (1 Corinthians 10:13)
```

And if you take action to complete the next
principle, your future will be blessed and secure!

```
“So don’t be anxious about tomorrow. God
will take care of your tomorrow too. Live
one day at a time.” (Matthew 6:34, TLB)
```
## Principle 2 Prayer

```
Dear God, I have tried to “fix” and
“control” my life’s hurts, hang-ups, or habits
all by myself. I admit that, by myself, I am
powerless to change. I need to begin to
believe and receive Your power to help me
recover. You loved me enough to send Your
Son to the cross to die for my sins. Help me be
open to the hope that I can only find in Him.
Please help me to start living my life one day
at a time. In Jesus’ name I pray, Amen.

# PRINCIPLE 2 VERSES

_“Remember that in the past you were
without Christ. You were not citizens of
Israel, and you had no part in the
agreements with the promise that God made
to his people. You had no hope, and you
did not know God. But now in Christ Jesus,
you who were far away from God are
brought near through the blood of Christ’s
death.” (Ephesians 2:12 – 13, NCV)_

_“But this precious treasure — this light and
power that now shine within us — is held in
a perishable container, that is, in our weak
bodies. Everyone can see that the glorious
power within must be from God and is not
our own. We are pressed on every side by
troubles, but not crushed and broken. We
are perplexed because we don’t know why
things happen as they do, but we don’t give
up and quit.” (2 Corinthians 4:7 – 8, TLB)_


```
“And this is the secret: that Christ in your
hearts is your only hope of glory.”
(Colossians 1:27, TLB)
```
```
“Don’t copy the behavior and customs of
this world, but be a new and different
person with a fresh newness in all you do
and think. Then you will learn from your
own experience how his ways will really
satisfy you.” (Romans 12:2, TLB)
```
_“He will not break the bruised reed, nor
quench the dimly burning flame. He will
encourage the fainthearted, those tempted
to despair. He will see full justice given to
all who have been wronged.” (Isaiah 42:3,
TLB)_


## Lesson 5

# TURN

**Principle 3** : Consciously choose to commit
all my life and will to Christ’s care and
control.

```
“Happy are the meek.” (Matthew 5:5)
```
**Step 3** : We made a decision to turn our lives
and our wills over to the care of God.

```
“Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters,
in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies
as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to
God — this is your true and proper
worship.” (Romans 12:1)
```

## Think About It

How do you TURN your life over to the one and
only Higher Power, Jesus Christ?

## T rust

Deciding to turn your life and your will over to
God requires only trust. Trust is putting the faith you
found in Principle 2 into action.

```
“If you confess that Jesus is Lord and
believe that God raised him from death,
you will be saved.” (Romans 10:9, GNT)
```
## U nderstand

Relying solely on your own understanding got
you into recovery in the first place! After you make
the decision to ask Jesus into your life, you need to
begin to seek His will for your life in all your
decisions.

```
“Trust in the LORD with all your heart and
lean not on your own understanding; in all
your ways submit to him, and he will make
```

```
your paths straight.” (Proverbs 3:5 – 6)
```
## R epent

To truly repent, you must not only _turn away_
from your sins, but _turn toward_ God. Repentance
allows you to enjoy the freedom of your loving
relationship with God.

```
“Turn from your sins and act on this
glorious news!” (Mark 1:15, TLB)
```
```
“Don’t let the world around you squeeze
you into its own mold, but let God remake
you so that your whole attitude of mind is
changed.” (Romans 12:2, PH)
```
## N ew life

After you ask Jesus into your heart, you will have
a new life! You will no longer be bound to your old
sin nature. God has declared you NOT GUILTY, and
you no longer have to live under the power of sin!

```
“Now God says he will accept and acquit
us — declare us ‘not guilty’ — if we trust
Jesus Christ to take away our sins.”
```

```
(Romans 3:22, TLB)
```
We will work on the “how tos” of TURNING our
life and will over to God in Lesson 6. But do not
forget this key point:
Turning your life over to Christ is a once-in-a-
lifetime commitment!
Turning your will over to Him requires a daily
_re_ commitment!
Pray the following prayer daily.

## Principle 3 Prayer

```
Dear God, I have tried to do it all by
myself, on my own power, and I have failed.
Today, I want to turn my life over to You. I
ask You to be my Lord and my Savior. You are
the One and only Higher Power! I ask that
You help me start to think less about me and
my will. I want to daily turn my will over to
You, to daily seek Your direction and wisdom
for my life. Please continue to help me
overcome my hurts, hang-ups, and habits and
may that victory over them help others as they
see Your power at work in changing my life.
Help me to do Your will always. In Jesus’
```

```
name I pray, Amen.

## Lesson 6

# ACTION

```
Principle 3 : Consciously choose to commit
all my life and will to Christ’s care and
control.
```
```
“Happy are the meek.” (Matthew 5:5)
```
```
Step 3 : We made a decision to turn our lives
and our wills over to the care of God.
```
_“Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view
of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as a living
sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God — this is your
true and proper worship.” (Romans 12:1)_


## Think About It

Even after taking the first two steps we can still
be stuck in the cycle of failure: guilt anger
fear depression!
How do we get “unstuck”? How do we get past
the barriers of pride, fear, guilt, worry, and doubt that
keep us from taking this step?
The answer is _we need to take ACTION!_

## A ccept Jesus Christ as your Higher

## Power and Savior!

Make the decision to ask Jesus into your heart.
Now is the time to commit your life, to establish that
personal relationship with Jesus that He so desires.

```
“If you confess with your mouth, ‘Jesus is
Lord,’ and believe in your heart that God
raised him from the dead, you will be
saved.” (Romans 10:9)
```
## C ommit to seek and follow HIS will!

We need to change our definition of willpower:
Willpower is the willingness to accept God’s power.


We see that there is no room for God if we are full of
ourselves.

```
“Teach me to do your will, for you are my
God; may your good Spirit lead me on
level ground.” (Psalm 143:9 – 10)
```
## T urn it over

“Let go; let God!” Turn over all the big things and
the little things in your life to your Higher Power.
Jesus Christ wants a relationship with _ALL_ of you.
What burdens are you carrying that you want to
_TURN OVER_ to God?

```
“Come to me and I will give you rest —
all of you who work so hard beneath a
heavy yoke. Wear my yoke — for it fits
perfectly — and let me teach you; for I am
gentle and humble, and you shall find rest
for your souls.” (Matthew 11:28 – 30,
TLB)
```
## I t’s only the beginning

In the third principle we make only the initial
decision, the commitment to seek and follow God’s


will. Our walk with our Higher Power, Jesus Christ,
begins with this decision and is followed by a lifelong
process of growing as a Christian.

```
“God who began the good work within
you will keep right on helping you grow in
his grace until his task within is finally
finished.” (Philippians 1:6, TLB)
```
## O ne day at a time

Recovery happens one day at a time. If we
remain stuck in the yesterday or constantly worry
about tomorrow, we will waste the precious time of
the present. We can only change our hurts, hang-ups,
and habits in the present.

```
“So don’t be anxious about tomorrow. God
will take care of your tomorrow too. Live
one day at a time.” (Matthew 6:34, TLB)
```
## N ext: How do I ask Christ into my life?

Ask yourself the following four questions (see

prayer that follows them. That’s it. That’s all you

# AFTERWORD

Now that you have completed all six lessons in
this guide to the best of your ability,
CONGRATULATIONS are most definitely in order!
In Principle 1 you faced your denial and admitted
that by yourself you were powerless to manage your
addictive or compulsive behavior.

```
“For I know that good itself does not
dwell in me, that is, in my sinful nature.
For I have the desire to do what is good,
but I cannot carry it out.” (Romans 7:18)
```
In Principle 2 you found the hope that God could
and would restore you to sanity, and that only He
could provide the power for you to recover.

```
“For God is at work within you, helping
you want to obey him, and then helping
you do what he wants.” (Philippians 2:13,
TLB)
```
```
And finally, in Principle 3, you were able to take
```

the action, to make the decision to turn your life and
your will over to God’s care and direction.

```
“And so, dear brothers, I plead with you
to give your bodies to God. Let them be a
living sacrifice, holy — the kind he can
accept. When you think of what he has
done for you, is that too much to ask?
(Romans 12:1, TLB)
```
Now, you are ready to take the next step in your
journey on the “Road to Recovery.” The next
participant’s guide deals with facing your past — the
good and the bad. Principle 4 can be difficult, but
remember you’re not going to go through it alone.
Your Higher Power, Jesus Christ, and others that He
has placed alongside you on your “Road to
Recovery” will be with you every step of the way.
